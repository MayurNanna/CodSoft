This GitHub repository contains code for three different tasks: Student Grade Calculator, ATM Interface, and Student Management System.


#  Task 1: Student Grade Calculator
This Java program calculates grades for students based on their marks in different subjects.
-  Features:
Prompts the user to choose a stream (PCM, PCB, or PCMB) and takes input for the respective subjects' marks.
Calculates the total score, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage.
Allows the user to navigate through different streams, input marks, and calculates grades.
Provides an option to exit the program or return to the main menu.
-  Usage:
Compile and run the GradeCalculator.java file.
Follow the prompts in the console to input marks and view grades.
-  Note:
This program offers a simplistic grade calculation mechanism and can be enhanced with additional features such as error handling and grade categorization.

#  Task 2: ATM Interface
This Java code represents a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system consisting of two classes: 'BankAccount' and 'ATM'.
-  Features:
The 'BankAccount' class manages a user's bank account, allowing deposits, withdrawals, and checking of the balance.
The 'ATM' class simulates the ATM machine functionalities such as displaying a menu for options like withdrawal, deposit, and balance checking.
-  Main Class:
The 'Main' class serves as the entry point, where a user can interact with the ATM system via a console interface.
It prompts the user to enter an initial balance, then presents a menu of options for the user to choose from (withdraw, deposit, check balance, or exit).
Depending on the user's choice, it interacts with the 'ATM' class to perform the corresponding action.
-  Usage:
Compile and run the Main.java file.
Follow the prompts in the console to perform desired ATM operations.
-  Note:
This code provides a basic ATM simulation suitable for educational purposes.
It does not include features like user authentication or data persistence, which are essential in real-world ATM systems.

#  Task 3: Student Management System
This project provides a basic implementation of a Student Management System in Java. It enables users to manage student records by performing operations like adding, removing, searching, and displaying students.
-  Features:
Add Student: Add a new student to the system with their name, roll number, and grade.
Remove Student: Remove a student from the system by specifying their roll number.
Search Student: Search for a student by their roll number and display their details if found.
Display All Students: Display details of all students currently in the system.
Exit: Terminate the application.
-  Usage:
Compile and run the StudentManagementSystem.java file.
Follow the prompts in the console to perform desired operations on student records.
-  Note:
Student records are stored in memory during runtime and are not persisted after the application exits.
This system serves as a basic example and can be expanded with additional features and data persistence mechanisms as needed.
